# Mission to Mars

## Overview 
This project is to automate a web browser to scrape, or extract, data about the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Mars exploration.  Instead of manually collecting and formatting the data, web scraping automates the process and eliminate the time consuming tasks of extracting online data for analysis.  The analysis consists of two parts as follows:  

 Part 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. The data is exported into a MongoDB database.
 Part 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Part 2: Answers based on the result.

1. How many months exist on Mars?
    A: 12 months 

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    A: 1,867 days 

3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? Get the answer by averaging the minimum daily temperature of all the months. Plot the results as a bar chart.
    A: The oldest month is March, and the warmest month is August.  

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? Get the answer by averaging the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months. Plot the results as a bar chart.
    A: The lowest atmospheric pressure month is June, and the highest atmospheric pressure month is September.  

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? That is, in the time that Mars circles the Sun once, how many days elapse on Earth? Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
    A: Based on the chart, it's approxmately 625 days.
